# Python101
*Learning Python at my own pace.*

Welcome to Python101 â€” a personal project where I document my journey of learning Python.
This repository will include practice exercises, small projects, notes, and experiments as I gradually build my Python skills.

## What's inside:
- Basic Python syntax
- Control structures (loops, conditionals)
- Functions and modules
- Object-Oriented Programming
- Data Structures (lists, dictionaries, sets, tuples)
- Projects and mini challenges
- Libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and more (coming soon!)

## Why this repo?
I'm learning at my own pace and using this space to practice, make mistakes, and grow.

Feel free to explore, learn alongside me, or even suggest improvements!
